<h3>François Deloche - Personal page</h3>

<p><i>About me:</i> I am a postdoctoral researcher and member of the <a href='https://www.waves.intec.ugent.be/hearing-technology'>Hearing Technology 
Lab</a> at Ghent University. I am currently working on transmission-line models to describe functional aspects of cochlear mechanics and the auditory periphery. My (broad) research interests are in: computational neuroscience (study of sensory systems), computational models of
the peripheral auditory system, non-linear cochlear signal processing, auditory neurophysiology (in particular: the auditory nerve compound action potential). I also conducted a research project on the modeling of speech rhythm perception using deep neural networks.

<i>Past me:</i> 

Between 2020 and 2022, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/auditory/">Auditory Neurophysiology & Modeling Lab</a> at Purdue University. I completed my PhD in computational neuroscience in 2019, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.lps.ens.fr/~nadal/">Jean-Pierre Nadal</a> (<a href="http://cams.ehess.fr/">CAMS</a> - EHESS, Paris). I am a former student of the <a href="http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/">MVA master</a> (applied and computational mathematics program on statistics, machine learning and signal processing).
